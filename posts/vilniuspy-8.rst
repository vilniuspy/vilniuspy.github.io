Hi Python Charmers,

As the summer is coming along and we have many other exciting events ahead like PyconLT 2017, the upcoming meetup will host only one talk.

While last meetups did not include any web development topics which many of you are interested in, in this one we will talk more about Django and its Asynchronous WebSockets.

Agenda
--------
1. **“Asynchronous WebSockets using Django” (EN) Albertas Gimbutas**

Albertas Gimbutas will introduce the concept of Asynchronous WebSockets. Then he will review the functionality of the Django channels package and will show a short example how can it be used in practice.

2. **Continue the meetup at a nearby bar for open discussion**

Where?
--------
Thanks Wix for letting us host the meeting in their Vilnius office at Rūdninkų st. 2 (OLD WIX OFFICE), in front of ŠMC. Call +370 678 18722 in case you need help finding the place.
