Hi Python Charmers, 

We are now back to regular talks. This month we have only one but it should be good. Hopefully on the upcoming months we can find more speakers, write to us if you are interested!

Agenda
--------
**1. "Prepare Spotify playlists with Machine Learning" (EN)  Dovydas Gulbinas** 

Dovydas will show how he used Machine Learning to automatically group songs into playlists and avoid lots of hassle by having to do it by hand.

**2. Continue the meetup at a nearby bar for open discussion**

Where?
--------
Thanks Wix for letting us host the meeting in their Vilnius office at Did≈æioji st. 28. Call +370 678 18722 in case you need help finding the place.
