The last meetup attracted a crowd of 40-50 people (photo below) and the talks were very informative and even entertaining when the 'Boom Boom Shake Shake' app that gathers sensor data was demonstrated. 

If you want to see those slides again or you've missed the meetup you can review them here:

- Romeo Kienzler - `Building Brains - Parallelisation strategies of large-scale deep learning neural networks on parallel scale out architectures like ApacheSpark <https://www.slideshare.net/ormium/parallelization-stategies-of-deeplearning-neural-network-training>`_ and also `Cognitive IoT using DeepLearning on data parallel frameworks like Spark & Flink <https://www.slideshare.net/ormium/cognitive-iot-using-deeplearning-on-data-parallel-frameworks-like-spark-flink>`_. Also, don't forget to subscribe to his `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_zIqSWu-yQcBAywLtHDAfg>`_ for more.
- `Albertas Gimbutas - Asynchronous WebSockets using Django </slides/DjangoWebSockets.pdf>`_
