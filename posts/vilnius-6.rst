Hi fellow Python Charmers,

We are excited to announce that after over a year long break VilniusPy is back! 

Agenda
--------

1. **“Why learn Python in 2017?” (EN) Karolis Ramanauskas**

Karolis Ramanauskas will be giving a semi-motivational talk about why today is a great time to learn Python. He will give an overview of the current state of the language, its application areas, and in the end will discuss Python’s future.

2. **“Python - the last language you’ll need to learn” (EN) Justas Trimailovas**

A more technical walkthrough about Python’s extensive standard library and great ecosystem of third party libraries.

3. **Continue the meetup at a nearby bar for open discussion**
