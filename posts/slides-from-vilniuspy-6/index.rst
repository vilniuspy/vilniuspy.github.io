Return of VilniusPy was a tremendous success. More than 70 people came to listen for 2 talks presented by Karolis and Justas.

If you want to see those slides again or you've missed the meetup you can review them here:

- `Karolis Ramanauskas - Why learn python in 2017 <https://www.slideshare.net/KarolisRamanauskas1/why-learn-python-in-2017>`_
- `Justas Trimailovas - Python: the last language you'll need to learn <http://trimailov.com/presentations/#/>`_

Thank you all for attending.
